Compare time, size and color transitions.

Visually check for fish that don't follow the normal progression and update the change database document as needed.  

I noticed that some fish were 7 and "Y" with a "J" sex assignment and the next year were 8.3 with "YP" and a "F" sex assignment.  I was going to question these, but then saw some fish that were 4.3 "Y" and the next year were 9.3 "YP", so I am allowing that fish can rapidly be promoted in the social strucutre if the situation allows it.
