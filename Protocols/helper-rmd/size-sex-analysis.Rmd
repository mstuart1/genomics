title: "Double check size vs. sex"
output: html_notebook
---
This notebook examines clownfish that are assigned a sex of female but are less than 8cm or a sex of male but are less than 7cm to make sure they have the correct sex assignment.

#This line of code installs the pacman page if you do not have it installed - if you do, it simply loads the package

Find fish whose size and sex don't match up
```{r eval=FALSE}
mismatch_males <- fish_anem_dive() %>% 
  mutate(size = as.numeric(size)) %>% 
  filter(sex == "M" & size < 7)

mismatch_females <- fish_anem_dive() %>%
  mutate(size = as.numeric(size)) %>% 
  filter(sex == "F" & size < 8)

```

Automatically change any fish smaller than 5cm to J. - Moved this text to the db_corrections script for safekeeping.

Try again without the small fish and only include fish on known anemones
```{r}
mismatch_males <- fish_anem_dive() %>% 
  mutate(size = as.numeric(size)) %>% 
  filter(sex == "M" & size < 7, 
         # fish must have been captured
         !is.na(tag_id) | !is.na(sample_id), 
         !is.na(anem_id))

mismatch_females <- fish_anem_dive() %>%
  mutate(size = as.numeric(size)) %>% 
  filter(sex == "F" & size < 8, 
         # fish must have been captured
         !is.na(tag_id) | !is.na(sample_id), 
         !is.na(anem_id))


```

Automatically change any fish that do not have an anem_id because can't compare to other fish - moved this chunk to the db_corrections script for safekeeping





Find other fish captured on same anemone in same field season.  I have to iterate through almost 300 fish.  Yay.
*Making this chunk eval=FALSE because I figured out how to automate some of these decisions*
```{r eval=FALSE}
# decision <- tibble()
# offline_db <- fish_anem_dive()
# save decision to first_decision and filter for uncaptured fish then restart this.
# first_decision <- decision
# mismatch <- mismatch %>%
#   filter(!is.na(sample_id) | !is.na(tag_id)) %>% 
#   filter(!fish_table_id %in% first_decision$fish_table_id) %>%
#   mutate(mismatch_id = 1:nrow(.))

one_fish <- mismatch %>% 
  filter(mismatch_id == i)

one_fish$sample_id
one_fish$tag_id
one_fish$gen_id
one_fish$anem_id
one_fish$anem_obs

# other_fish <- fish_anem_dive() %>% 
other_fish <- offline_db %>% 
  filter(
    anem_id == one_fish$anem_id,
         # date == one_fish$date
         # , 
    anem_obs == one_fish$anem_obs
         # , tag_id == one_fish$tag_id
         # , gen_id == one_fish$gen_id
         ) %>% 
  select(-dive_notes, -dive_corr_message, -cover) %>% 
  arrange(size)

knitr::kable(other_fish)

# whats_up <- tibble(fish_table_id = one_fish$fish_table_id, decision = "Change sex from F to J, larger fish captured on anemone.")
whats_up <- tibble(fish_table_id = one_fish$fish_table_id, decision = "No change.")

decision <- rbind(decision, whats_up) %>% 
  distinct()

i <- i + 1

# save up to this point as second decision and see if you can automate the questions below.
second_decision <- decision

```
The questions I am asking are - is this the largest fish captured that day? - yes = look deeper, no = change to J
Deeper:
Is this this largest fish captured ever? If yes, no change, if no, go deeper.

If a fish is larger, is it a recapture of this fish?  if yes, no change, if no, flag for follow up.

Prep data for entry into db using the leyteBuildDB repo, db_corrections script dated 2019-04-04 and 2019-04-08.
```{r eval=FALSE}
change <- females %>% 
  filter(grepl("F to J", decision))

# saveRDS(change, "../../leyteBuildDB/data/F-should-be-J.RData")

no_change <- females %>% 
  filter(grepl("No change", decision))
# saveRDS(no_change, "../../leyteBuildDB/data/no-change-F.RData")
```
Updated the db with these females to J.
Updated the db with females that cannot be changed.

Which fish are still raising a flag as small F?  These fish are the largest fish captured that day but not the largest fish ever captured.  Are they recaptures?
```{r}
followup <- females %>% 
  filter(grepl("Follow", decision))

# these fish

Check the fish that are flagged for follow up
- Made a github issue #8 comment about what to do with a fish that is the largest fish captured in the most recent year, but not the largest of all time.  Are the other fish dead and this is now YP or did we miss the bigger fish?
```{r}
follow_up <- filter(females, grepl("Follow up", decision)) %>% 
  rename(male_id = female_id) %>% 
  rbind(filter(males, grepl("Follow up", decision))) %>% 
  rename(mismatch_id = male_id) %>% 
  mutate(mismatch_id = 1:nrow(.))

i <- 18

one_fish <- follow_up %>% 
    filter(mismatch_id == i)

all_fish <- fish_anem_dive() %>% 
      filter(anem_obs == one_fish$anem_obs, 
             fish_spp == "APCL") %>% 
      arrange(size) %>% 
  select(date, everything())
