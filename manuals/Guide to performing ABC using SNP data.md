# Guide to performing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) using SNP dataApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a powerful statistical framework that can be used to estimate demographic parameters from large genomic data sets. In the past few years, many useful review papers have been published on ABC methods, so check out some of those papers for further details (See ‘ABC Resources’ section below). Briefly, a large number of simulations are performed, with parameters being drawn from a probability distribution. The simulated genetic data are then reduced to summary statistics. The choice of summary statistics to use in ABC is up to you, but many studies employing SNP data use the site frequency spectrum (SFS). Next, the simulated summary statistics are compared to the observed statistics and a metric of distance is calculated. The associated sampled parameters are then either accepted or rejected based on their distance metric, yielding parameters whose summary statistics most closely match those of the observed data. ## Simulating with fastsimcoal2:Before beginning, I highly recommend reading through the fastsimcoal2 manual (<http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal2/man/fastsimcoal25.pdf>) to familiarize yourself with how to structure input files and run fastsimcoal2 on the command line. There is also a Google group where you can seek advice from fastsimcoal2 users (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fastsimcoal>). Fastsimcoal2 a continuous-time coalescent simulator of genomic diversity under arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios. The flexibility of fastsimcoal2 allows you to create simulations based on the complexity of your system and question of interest. Sampling parameter values from prior distributions requires two input files: a template file and an estimation file. The template file describes the demographic model being simulated. The estimation file describes the distribution and prior bounds for the parameters that are to be sampled. Detailed instructions and options for the template and estimation files are described in the fastsimcoal2 manual. Here, I am simulating SNP data (but see Note below) to estimate dispersal (DISP) between two populations of constant size (POPONE & POPTWO).### **An example template file (migrationABC_test.tpl)**:
	//Anything preceded by // is a comment. You can remind yourself of what is being simulated up here.	//Number of population samples	2	//Population effective sizes (=2N, number of alleles).	POPONE	POPTWO	//Sample sizes: # samples (=2N, number of alleles). These numbers should reflect your observed data.	270	194	//Growth rates. Both populations are not growing in this case.	0	0	//Number of migration matrices : If 0 : No migration between demes	1	//migration matrix: sources in rows, sinks in columns (backwards in time). In this example, dispersal from POPONE to POPTWO and vice versa are the same, DISP.	0 DISP	DISP 0	//Historical event format: time, src, sink, % mig, new Ne scaling factor for sink, new r, new mig matrix. No historical events in this case.	0	//Number of chromosomes	10 0	//Number of linkage blocks on Chromosome 1 (per chromosome)	1	//Per Block: Data type, No. of loci, Recombination rate to the right-side locus, plus optional parameters	DNA 100 0 1E-8 0.33**A note on simulating SNP data**:
Simulation of SNP data is not as easy as indicating the SNP data type in the template file. There is a section in the fastsimcoal2 manual about the simulation of SNP data; be sure to read it. With the SNP data type, you'll have one mutation irrespective of the length of the genealogy, and mutation rate is irrelevant, so you’ll end up with a biased SFS. Instead, SNP data should be simulated as a DNA fragment. Thus, simulating realistic SNPs using the DNA data type requires some careful thought about the ‘Number of chromosomes’, the DNA sequence length and the mutation rate. Use your observed data to inform how many SNPs should be simulated, and be mindful of how SNPs are being simulated within the context of the computational power available to you. You will likely need to test multiple template files to optimize the number of simulated SNPs. For example, the above template file simulates DNA of sequence length 100 with a mutation rate of 1E-8, which is typical of SNPs. The template file indicates that this should be done 10 times. These settings will get you a handful of SNPs, but if you need more simulated SNPs in order to match your observed data, you will need to increase the ‘Number of chromosomes’. For example, to make sure that I got at least 663 SNPs in each simulation, I set 'Number of Chromosomes' to 1000000 (This is computationally intensive!). Alternatively, you could increase the mutation rate or the DNA sequence length to simulate more SNPs, but then you will have more linked SNPs (I did not do this because I was working with ddRAD data). I also tried simulating DNA of sequence length 1 with a very high value for ‘Number of chromosomes’ but the computation time with these settings was unreasonable.### **An example template file (migrationABC_test.est)**:	// Priors and rules file 	// *********************	[PARAMETERS]	//#isInt?	#name	#dist.	#min	#max	//all N are in number of haploid individuals	1 POPONE logunif 100 100000 output	1 POPTWO logunif 100 100000 output	0 DISP unif 0 0.5 output	[RULES]	[COMPLEX PARAMETERS]	To start the fastsimcoal2 simulations type:
	./fsc25221 -t migrationABC_test.tpl -e migrationABC_test.est -n 1 -E 500 -g -q -s 0 -m -c 6 -B 12This command will draw 500 sets of parameters (-E) and perform a single simulation per set (-n). Arlequin project outputs (*.arp ) will be generated in genotypic (-g; diploid) format and the minor allele site frequency spectrum will be computed and output (-m). DNA data is output as SNP data and all SNPs in the DNA sequence are output (-s 0). More options can be found in the fastsimcoal2 manual.## Performing ABC:There are many ways to actually perform ABC, but I used the abc package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html) in R. To perform ABC, you need to read three things into R: a file with the sampled parameters, a file with the summary statistics of the simulated data and a file with the summary statistics of the observed data. Each line in the parameters and simulated summary statistic files should correspond to the same simulation. You may need to manipulate the simulated summary statistics to account for any bioinformatics filters that were used on the observed data (i.e. minor allele frequency) or down sample your simulations so that all simulations are based on the same number of SNPs as your observed data (assuming you use the fastsimcoal2 -s 0 option). The abc ‘tol’ option describes the proportion of accepted simulations closest to the target and the ‘method’ option describes the ABC algorithm to be applied.To perform ABC using the abc package after you have read in the necessary files:
	calcs <- abc(target = obs.sumstats, param = full_params, sumstat = sub.sfs.all, tol = 0.01, method = 'rejection’)You can plot your ABC results using the plot.abc fuction in the abc R package if you use the ‘loclinear’ or ‘neuralnet’ method. If you use the ‘rejection’ method, you can plot the ABC results on your own:
	pdf(file = 'abc_filename.pdf')                          # saves plots as a pdf	par(mfrow = c(2,2))	popone <- rlunif(1000, 100, 100000)                     # the prior distribution I used for POPONE	plot(density(popone, bw = 2000, adjust = 1, cut = 3))   # plots POPONE prior distribution	lines(density(calcs$unadj.values[,1], bw = 2000, adjust = 1, cut = 3), col='blue') # draws density plot of POPONE values from simulations kept from abc 	poptwo <- rlunif(10000, 100, 100000)                    # the prior distribution I used for POPTWO	plot(density(poptwo, bw = 2000, adjust = 1, cut = 3))	lines(density(calcs$unadj.values[,2], bw = 2000, adjust = 1, cut = 3), col='blue')	disp <- runif(10000, 0, 0.5)                            # the prior distribution I used for DISP		plot(density(disp, bw = 0.02, adjust = 1, cut =3), ylim = c(0, 3))	lines(density(calcs$unadj.values[,3], bw = 0.02, adjust = 1, cut = 3), col='blue') 	dev.off()                                               # returns output to the R console## ABC Resources:Bertorelle, G., Benazzo, A.& Mona, S.
