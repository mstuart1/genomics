# This script is written to take the filtered genepop file from dDocent and 
# 1) read the genepop file into R as a data frame
# 2) strip any named samples down to pure ligation number, 
# 3) identify and remove re-genotyped samples based on number of loci (SNPs), 
# 4) generate a new genepop file to be fed to cervus for identification of recaptures.

# Set up workspace ---------------------------------------------

# 1) Read the genepop  - double check genepop to make sure the word
# pop separates the header from the data on line 3 - no quotes

# locate the genepop file and read as data frame
genfile <- "data/seq17_03g95maf2q30dp15.gen"

# 2) strip any named samples down to pure ligation number ---- 

# create a search term to search for ligation ids within a name
ligid <- "(.+)(L\\d\\d\\d\\d)" 

# an L followed by 4 digits, while APCL also contains an L, it shouldn't ever be followed by 4 digits, except in 2015...apparently the sample_id numbers were truncated in 2015 samples for dDocent which is why we can only go by ligation_id to identify these samples.

# TEST - what does this search string find?

# change all of the names to ligation id only
