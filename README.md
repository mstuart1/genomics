Genomics in the Pinsky Lab
================

## From fish to SNPs, many steps are involved in obtaining and processing our data.

  - Sample collection can be found in the
    [field](https://github.com/pinskylab/field) repository.  

  - Sample processing through sequence submission can be found in the
    [laboratory](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/tree/master/genomics/laboratory)
    repository.  

  - Sequence processing through identity analysis (mark recapture) can
    be found here in the genomics repository.

Open this Rproject on the RStudio Server on amphiprion to use for steps
1-4 (i-iv).  
Our reference.fasta file was assembled by Jon Puritz using dDocent and
300 individuals from our APCL sample set.

### Navigation

#### Pubs

A manuscript in progress by Michelle.

#### Data

Data files required to run the scripts. **Quick note**: Due to a type-o
that was propogated through data file names, the data set is called
seq03-33 but actually only contains SEQ03 through SEQ31, and only the
sequencing runs that contain APCL data.

## Plots

[plot-clownfish-at-size-change-M-to-F.md](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/plots/plot-clownfish-at-size-change-from-M-to-F.md)
- graphic output version of the code to produce plots.  
[plot-clownfish-at-size-change-M-to-F.Rmd](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/plots/plot-clownfish-at-size-change-from-M-to-F.Rmd)
- notebook to produce size distrubtion plots.  
[plot-clownfish-at-size-change-M-to-F\_figures](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/tree/master/plots/plot-clownfish-at-size-change-from-M-to-F_files/figure-markdown_github)
- folder holding png images of the size distribution plots.  
[where\_caught.pdf](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/plots/where_caught.pdf)
- a pdf of a plot of the number of fish captured on the same anemone or
different anemones from the original capture.

## Rmd

The protocols listed in the steps above. If vieiwng on github, the .md
files are the easiest way to view these files. If you want to run the
scripts, open the .Rmd files through RStudio or render them with regular
R by typing into the R command line:

``` r
rmarkdown::render("file_name.Rmd")
```

## R

Old scripts that are no longer used but may be helpful for problem
solving.
