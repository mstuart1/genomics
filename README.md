Genomics in the Pinsky Lab
================

## From fish to SNPs, many steps are involved in obtaining and processing our data.

  - Sample collection can be found in the
    [field](https://github.com/pinskylab/field) repository.  

  - Sample processing through sequence submission can be found in the
    [laboratory](https://github.com/pinskylab/laboratory)
    repository.  

  - Sequence processing through identity analysis (mark recapture) can
    be found here in the genomics repository.

        calling](Protocols/01_hiseq_workflow.md)
    2.  [Call SNPs](Protocols/01_hiseq_workflow.md)
    3.  [Plot the raw SNPs to visualize the
        data](Protocols/03_raw_data_figures_template.md)
    4.  [Filter SNPs](Protocols/04_filtering_scheme-6-with-70-35.md)
    5.  [Remove regenotyped individuals](Protocols/05_remove-regenos.md)
    6.  [Identify recaptured
        individuals](Protocols/06_identity-protocol.md)
    7.  [Update recaptured RData file](Protocols/07_recaptured-fish.md)

Open this Rproject on the RStudio Server on amphiprion to use for steps
1-4 (i-iv).  
Our reference.fasta file was assembled by Jon Puritz using dDocent and
300 individuals from our APCL sample set.

### Navigation

#### [Protocols](Protocols)

Step by step guides to processing sequencing data. Make a copy of these
files and update that copy with the specifics you encountered during
your analysis to serve as a lab notebook. The protocols listed in the
steps above. If vieiwng on github, the .md files are the easiest way to
view these files. If you want to run the scripts, open the .Rmd files
through RStudio or render them with regular R by typing into the R
command line:

``` r
rmarkdown::render("file_name.Rmd")
```

#### [R](R)

Old scripts that are no longer used but may be helpful for problem
solving.

#### [data](data)

Data files required to run the scripts.

#### [filtering](filtering)

Scripts for filtering vcf files.

#### [lab-notebooks](lab-notebooks)

Records of how sample runs were processed. A copy of the protocol step
was saved into this folder and renamed to represent the samples that
were being worked on. These are best viewed as html files.

#### [manuals](manuals)

Manufacturer manuals and guides.
