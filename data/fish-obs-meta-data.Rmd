The fish_obs.Rdata file is created in the [remove-regenos](pinskylab/genomics/scripts/05_remove-regenos.Rmd) script by   
1. filtering the database for any sample_id found in the current genepop file that contains all successfully sequenced individuals (no regenotypes or recaptures have been removed from this genepop).  Only the columns of sample_id, tag_id, and fish_table_id are kept.
2. The database is queried again for any fish that has a tag_id that was not included in the table above. Again the columns of sample_id, tag_id and fish_table_id are kept.  
3. These 2 tables are bound into one table of all fish that have been successfully genotyped and/or pit-tagged, saved as an RData file, [fish-obs.RData]((pinskylab/genomics/data/fish-obs.RData)
